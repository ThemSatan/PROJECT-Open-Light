<h2>Description</h2><br>
Lost in a place that looks like your home, but is it really?<br>
Explore and get to the end before it gets to you.<br>
<br>
Movement: WASD<br>
Interaction: Left mouse button (the cursor icon changes when hovering over an interactible object)<br>
<br>
Big thank you goes to my friend Plawrooo who helped me with a few scripts and with a little bit of building. I also thank Kyom_9393 for building the locker model that can be seen at the Main Room, it looks horrible.<br>
<br>
This game was created as a school project! There is much more to come (hopefully) after I get this graded :]<br>
