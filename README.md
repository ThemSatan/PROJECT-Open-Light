<h2>Description</h2><br>
Lost in a place that looks like your home, but is it really?<br>
Explore and get to the end before it gets to you.<br>

Goal of the game is to get to the end of the map and open the big door. Can you survive when it hunts though? Hide in lockers and wardrobes from it when the lights turn off.<br>

Big thank you goes to my friend <a href="https://github.com/Plawro">Plawro</a> who helped me with a few scripts and with a little bit of building. I also thank <a href="https://github.com/Kyom9393">Kyom9393</a> for building the locker model that can be seen at the Main Room, it looks horrible.<br>
